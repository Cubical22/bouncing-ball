# Bouncing Ball Project
This is a simple test I did to get back to the world of coding. Mainly just to remember the syntax and such. Plus, It helped me grasp some simple ideas, mostly about vectors and managing a simple physical movement. <br>
Here's a couple options I applied to try out<br>
- *RIGHT CLICK*: adding gravity points
- *Q*: remove gravity points
- *W*: turn gravity on/off
- *E*: slow down the ball in case of emergency (half the speed)
- *R*: turn filling on/off
